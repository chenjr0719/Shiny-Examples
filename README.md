## What is Shiny?

**Shiny** is a web application framework for **R**.

It can help developer develop there interactive Analysis tools easier.

You don't have to learn **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and others.

## About This Examples?

This Examples implement such as **Standard Statistics Test**, **Clustering**, **Classification**.

You use some dataset which already build in **R** or you can upload your own **.CSV** files.

The detail is following:

### Standard Statistics Test

In **Standard Statistics Test**, it contains:

* Regression
* Paired T Test
* One-Way ANOVA
* MANOVA

### Clustering

In **Clustering**, it contains:

* K-Means
* EM
* DBSCAN
* Spectral

### Classification

In **Classification**, it contains:

* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Support Vector Machine
* Naive Bayes Classifier
* Feed-Forward Neural Network

## How to Use?

If you want to use this example, you have to build a shiny server first.

Thanks for **Docker**, you can build shiny server in a simple way.
